In other practice problems, we have looked at how the scope of variables affects 
the modification of one "layer" when they are passed to another.

To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope and modification of one scope by 
another, consider the following similar sets of code.

What will be printed by each of these code groups?

A)"one is: one"
  "two is: two"
  "three is: three"
B)"one is: one"
  "two is: two"
  "three is: three"
C)"one is: two"
  "two is: thee"
  "three is: one"
