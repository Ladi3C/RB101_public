      Given an array of strings representing integers, iterate through all of the items in the array. 
      If the integer value of the string is odd add it to a new array of odd integer strings.
      Once iteration is complete the new array should contain all of the odd integer strings from
      the original array.

input: array of strings representing integers
output: array of odd values from input
