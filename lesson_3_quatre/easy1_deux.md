Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. What is != and where should you use it?

    `!=` means not equal to and should be used in a conditional.

2. Put ! before something, like !user_name

    opposite of boolean equivalent

3. Put ! after something, like words.uniq!
  
    `! ` After something is an indicator for mutation.

4. Put ? before something

    not?

5. Put ? after something

    Either for ternerary operator or for validation.

6. Put !! before something, like !!user_name

    Same as the boolean ex. true == !!true =>false
