```ruby
def fix(value)
  value.upcase!
  value.concat('!')
  value
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)
```

On `line 9` local variable `t` is *initialized* and *assigned* to the *return value* of method fix invoked and local variable `s` passed in as an argument. Local variable `s` is *initialized* and *assigned* to a string object with the value of `'hello'`. On `line 2` method definition `fix` is defined with local variable `value` as its parameter. At this point both local variable `s` and local variable `value` are pointing to the same string object, `'hello'`. 

On `line 3`, the `#upcase!` method is invoked on what the string object `value` is referencing. This will upcase the string object *permanently* because `#upcase!` is a destructive method (the bang suffix is an indicator for mutability). On `line 4` the `#concat` method is called on `value` with a `'!'` passed in as an argument. The `#concat` method is also a destructive method and will permanently append a `'!'` to the string object `value` is referencing. The return value of the `fix` method with local variable `s` as its argument is `'HELLO!'`, which is assigned to local variable `t` on `line 9`. 

This problem demonstrates object passing and mutability of objects in Ruby. Method definitions are self contained and can only access local variable initialized in the outer scope if they are *explicitly* passed in as arguments. Method definitions are *defined* with parameters and *called* with arguments. The local variable `s` passed in to the method `fix` was mutated on `lines 3 - 4` and because both local variable `s` and `value` were referencing the same object, the mutation is reflected in both variables.
