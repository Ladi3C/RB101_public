My team is working on some reporting functionality for the SALES DEPARTMENT.

PRODUCE code that lets the SALES DEPARTMENT report on :

    - the value of orders PER customer
      - Each order is represented by a HASH within an ARRAY
        - There MAY be more than one order per customer

Sales Department: 

      1. The total value of orders for EACH customer                   VALUE
      2. The total value of FULFILLED orders for each customer         FULFILLED


EXAMPLE:


order_data = [
  {customer_id: 12, customer_name: 'Emma Lopez', order_id: 351, order_date: '12/04/16', order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 135.99},
  {customer_id: 12, customer_name: 'Emma Lopez', order_id: 383, order_date: '12/04/16', order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 289.49},
  {customer_id: 12, customer_name: 'Emma Lopez', order_id: 392, order_date: '01/10/17', order_fulfilled: false, order_value: 58.00},
  {customer_id: 32, customer_name: 'Michael Richards', order_id: 241, order_date: '11/10/16', order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 120.00},
  {customer_id: 32, customer_name: 'Michael Richards', order_id: 395, order_date: '01/10/17', order_fulfilled: false, order_value: 85.65},
  # rest of data...
]

My team approaches the problem in TWO STAGES:

      1) Convert the initial data structure to a more usable format
      2) Extract the required information from the restructured data

PROBEM: Test your ability to READ and UNDERSTAND code.
        TRY to ANSWER these questions by EXAMINING and MENTALLY parsing what the cose is
        doing rather than simply running the code samples.
